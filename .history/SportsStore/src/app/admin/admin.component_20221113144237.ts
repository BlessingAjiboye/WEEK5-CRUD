import { Component } from "@angular/core";
@Component({
    templateUrl: "admin.component.html"
})
export class AdminComponent {}
Listing 9-3.The Contents of the admin.component.ts File in the src/app/admin Folder
The component doesnâ€™t contain any functionality at the moment. To provide a template for the component, I added a file called admin.component.html to the src/app/admin folder and the placeholder content shown in Listing 9-4.
<div class="bg-info p-2 text-white">
  <h3>Placeholder for Admin Features</h3>
</div>
